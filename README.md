# GameOfGames

Game of Games was made as a final group project in software engineering principals  

Game of Games is a simulation of common games such as flipping a coin and guessing a number. The player faces a computer opponent to play these games untill they decide to stop.

The goal of the project was to implement the design of a different group of students using clean coding principals including:
  - Object oriented design
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  
  I was responsible for coding: 
  - RedThread.java
  - GetInput.java
